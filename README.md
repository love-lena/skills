## Skills

### [`status-board`](./skills/status-board/SKILL.md)

Turn active engineering work into a self-contained HTML decision surface. It leads with the single highest-leverage next action, maps a PR stack in dependency order, and lays out the complete path to shipped.

Optimized for stacked pull requests, but also works for project milestones and active coding sessions. Existing boards update in place; stale blockers, resolved history, code-level implementation debris, and unsupported claims stay out.

### [`change-story`](./skills/change-story/SKILL.md)

Tell the story of a code change — a single PR, a stack of PRs, or any diff — as a two-column walkthrough:

- **Left column** — a continuous prose chapter that names the change and tells the reader what to care about.
- **Right column** — a surface-grouped *code map* that covers every hunk in the diff and frames the load-bearing ones with paragraphs of context.

The prose names *consequences* and points "chips" (line-range markdown links) at the map; the map covers every hunk and explains the *mechanics* next to the code.

Outputs three portable markdown artifacts: `prose.md`, `map.md`, `diff.patch`. The files are readable on their own; a renderer that understands the chip-and-fence convention can also lay them out as a two-column page.

### [`manta`](./skills/manta/SKILL.md)

Round-trip documents to a [Supernote Manta](https://supernote.com) e-ink tablet for handwritten annotation:

- **Send** — render any markdown into an editorial-format PDF (13pt, double-spaced, generous bottom margin) sized for redlining, dropped straight into the device's review inbox.
- **Pull** — composite the handwritten `.pdf.mark` annotations back onto the source PDF as a single flattened file.
- **Read** — an Opus pass over the flattened PDF recovers what the annotations say and merges them into the source draft.

Resolves the Supernote desktop sync folder dynamically (no hardcoded device id) and auto-builds its `supernotelib` venv on first use. macOS.

### [`writing-style`](./skills/writing-style/SKILL.md)

Write prose in lena's voice — and get better at it over time:

- **`SKILL.md`** (immutable) carries the universal craft rules — flowing prose, every sentence earns its place, cut the slop — plus a read/record protocol.
- **`STYLE.md`** is a living memory of learned preferences. The skill reads it before drafting; after a draft gets feedback, it records what it learned, consolidating rather than just appending.

Ships seeded with a few preferences (concise *ideas* not short sentences; lead with the conclusion; plain and literal; no first- or second-person pronouns) and grows from edits, A/B picks, and notes. Not for code.
